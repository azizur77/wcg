General Description:
This is a Python implementation for analyzing large social graphs such as Facebook. It uses networkx Python library for building and analyzing the structure of Facebook friendship graph.

It can read the structure of an online social network in csv format and then convert that to a graph structure representation for further analysis. This project in particular has the implemntation for:

- building graphs
- drawing graphs by using matplot library
- computing bridges and communities in social graphs
- running BFS on social graphs
- running random walk on social graphs
- computing similarity between nodes neighborhood using minhash
- running several information spreading algorithms in social graphs
- and other features not listed here!

Code Input:
A csv file representing the adjacency list of an online social network.

Code Output:
Detail connectivity and other properties of social graphs.

Project Goal:
Analyzing structure of Facebook friendship graph.

Project Period:
January 2011 - May 2012.
